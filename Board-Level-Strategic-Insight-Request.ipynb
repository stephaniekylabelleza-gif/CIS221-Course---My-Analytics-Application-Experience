    "Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A mid-sized financial institution has been actively expanding its personal loan portfolio. However, recent shifts in customer behavior and credit risk profiles have prompted the Board of Directors to revisit the underlying factors influencing loan approvals and amounts granted. The board is particularly concerned with credit risk, profitability, and data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a quarterly strategy meeting, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) presents a dashboard highlighting inconsistencies in the average loan amounts issued across customer segments. Some applicants with moderate income and lower credit scores are receiving higher-than-expected loan amounts, while more qualified applicants appear to be under-leveraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response, the Chairperson of the Board raises a crucial question:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Among all the customer attributes we’ve been collecting—like income, credit score, employment history, age, debt-to-income ratio, and education level—can we clearly identify which of these factors have the strongest statistical relationship with the loan amount issued?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The board mandates the Data Analytics Team to conduct an immediate correlation analysis to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify which factors most strongly drive loan amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Distinguish between statistically significant vs. insignificant variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Support future decisions about automating loan approvals, tightening risk thresholds, or tailoring products to specific customer profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Business Analytics Report that address the request of the board."
